<h1>BusRoute: Command Line Bus Planner. </h1>

<img src="busroute.jpg" width=200 height=200><p>

<b>Overview:</b><p>

This is  a bus  scheduler in the  sense that  you give it  a <em>start
address</em>, a <em>destination address</em>, and a <em>time</em>, and
it returns a robust bus plan to get you there ASAP.  It is also useful
as a transportation planning module for the Verber/SHOPS complex.<p>

The system further aims to integrate with a map routing system such as
the open  source Roadmap  or TMRS systems,  to provide the  ability to
calculate the quickest plan to reach a given location.<p>

Its really funny  that everyone seems to agree that  the bus system is
useful.   In fact,  the bus  system  is practically  the most  useless
system I have written.  However, it has the greatest perceived need by
others.  Writing such  a system goes entirely against  the approach of
the FRDCSA.  The reason  I wrote it is that I don't  have access to my
servers,  and hence  my real  development environment,  so  I couldn't
really accomplish anything since all the problems I have solved in the
past can't assist me.  I was  sick of spending hours waiting for buses
that weren't  showing according to my  poor mental bus  schedule, so I
thought I would  simply provide a bus planning module  to Verber so as
to more  efficiently utilize that  time, given the expectation  that I
would use it and so would others.<p>

This  just shows  that  people can't  see  what's in  their long  term
interest,  since this system  has only  modest shortest  term benefit.
I'm only writing  it to function properly with my  long term plans, as
sort  of a  diversion.   Yet, I've  gotten  the most  interest out  of
EVERYONE in this  system.  Of course I'm not  going to convince anyone
with these  arguments, so I should  start working on Verber  so that I
can accomplish  more of my  short term goals  in pursuit of  my longer
term goals  to create argumentative reasoners that  will refute common
fallacies much easier. <p>

Perhaps you noticed that the  plan is rather ridiculous.  This appears
to  be  due  to the  brittleness  in  the  system  since we  have  not
incorporated walking movements or  more detailed bus stop information.
We also  haven't handled many cases properly,  resulting in propobable
information  loss.   So it  doesn't  seem to  be  a  problem with  the
algorithm.   I  made  up   some  crappy  algorithm  with  some  flawed
assumptions which does pretty well, I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm
with some bugs, and  plan to move to A* since this  appears to be much
more efficient with  sparse matrix data.  It has been  a while since I
have done  algorithms, so I seem  rather inept.  Although  I coded the
entire system in one night.<p>

This software aims to improve our ability to reason with the objective
consequeunces of our actions, which is of course necessary in order to
act morally and ethically.<p>

So  the possiblity  of incorporating  plans which  are very  robust is
something we should certainly do  here since this improves the results
and utility  of any planning  process, and is  in a certain  sense the
entire reason we wish to do this.<p>
