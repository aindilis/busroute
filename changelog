	Made  some changes  of uncertain  value.  Skipped  sorting  of all
	route segments,  and just made  sort happen dynamically,  but take
	less time, by only sorting amongst routes departing routes leaving
	within  a  time range.   This  way  we do  not  have  to sort  all
	departing route segments, which decreases run time.  However, this
	mechanism is not currently full proof since it would seem to screw
	departures leaving  more than  2 hours from  now.  This  should be
	adjusted to the current time  cutoff instead.  Then it may work as
	an optimization.
